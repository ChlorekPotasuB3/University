On the one hand, a great versatility, both in the business field and in a public context, which is a competitive advantage in the labour market, compared to those specialists in one of the two fields. On the other hand, the rigorous analysis of economic-financial foundations and analytical techniques enable students to continue, if they so wish, with the preparation of a doctoral thesis in Economics or Finance.

Emphasis is put on developing strong analytical skills that will allow our graduates to solve complex economic problems in various areas. Applicants must have a solid background in Mathematics and a good command of English. Courses are taught both by faculty members of the Institute of Economic Studies (IES) and external professionals from international institutions, central banks, and the financial industry. Graduates typically assume challenging positions in banking, consulting, investment funds, international financial institutions, or they pursue an academic career at respected international universities. Compulsory courses introduce students to advanced topics in macroeconomics, microeconomics, and econometrics. Elective courses cover a wide range of areas in economics and finance and let students specialize in the field of their interest. The topics include applied economics and economic policy (e.g. monetary economics, international macroeconomics, antitrust economics, public economics, health economics, environmental economics, development economics, energy economics, and economics of the EU), banking and finance (banking, financial markets, corporate finance, asset pricing, company valuation, real estate investment, bank asset, and liability management, and financial regulation)), and advanced empirical methods (e.g. macroeconometrics, applied microeconometrics, financial econometrics, data science, and DSGE modeling).",

The art historical curriculum is paired with six credits of fine art studio classes, which allow our students to become familiar with traditional methods of fine art production including painting, printmaking, and sculpture. This marriage of art history and fine art studies offers a perspective through which art and its historical trajectory can be uniquely evaluated and appreciated. Students will complete their degree by writing an M.A. thesis, with the support and advisement of an Art History faculty member. The thesis will be written in the student's chosen area of art historical specialization demonstrating independent scholarly research and highlighting their joint understanding of art and its creative process.",

As the most famous Lithuanian architect of his time, Gucevičius introduced a new direction in architecture - classicism based on interpretations of antique architecture heritage - and createdthe classicistic face of the city. While these two buildings were only two of many in the center of Vilnius, they clearly demonstrated the architect's ideas on social equality during the epoch of Enlightenment.",

All offered courses and design studies are based on the \"Research by design\" model, and their wide choice allows students to pursue individual creative interests. Students have the opportunity to work with active architects, with specialists in various fields, and they can also participate in scientific programmes, international exchanges, workshops and study trips. After completion of the Master’s programme in Architecture and Urban Planning students are awarded the Master’s Degree in Architecture. Graduates are equipped with knowledge and skills that enable them to enrol themselves on doctoral and specialised postgraduate programmes.",
